# Sentiment-analysis-using-ML

This project focuses on sentiment analysis of textual data, aiming to automatically identify and classify opinions expressed in text as positive, negative, or neutral. 
With the rapid growth of user-generated content such as reviews, social media posts, and feedback, sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding public opinion and customer perception.

The system preprocesses raw text data and applies natural language processing techniques to extract meaningful features. 
Machine learning and deep learning models are then used to learn sentiment patterns and predict sentiment polarity. 
The project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline, including text cleaning, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
